# CheekiJailbreeki
A 10.2.1 jailbreak for 64-bit devices, for all squatters and communists

*Please note: this is work in progress, currently it only are the exploits by Adam Donefeld for IOSurface and AVEncoder adopted into a xCode project with the right linker settings so it is easier to compile into an iPhone app for anyone.*

# Jailbreakers of all nations unite!
Add the offsets for iPhone 6 on 10.3.1 to speed up the progress.
(This project uses only the xcode settings of yalu for compilation convenience. No actual code of yalu was used.)


# Will support
- iPhone SE (10.2.1)
- iPhone 6S / 6+ (10.2.1)
- iPhone 6 / 6+ (10.2.1)

# Future devices

- iPod devices (10.2.1 arm64)

# Might not support
